## Responsive Behavior & Browser Support

- The layout adapts gracefully across **mobile**, **tablet**, and **desktop** screen sizes using CSS Grid and Flexbox.
- Tested on the latest versions of **Chrome**, **Firefox**, **Safari**, and **Edge**.
- Requires a browser that supports ES6 syntax (e.g., `class`, `let/const`, arrow functions).
